# My "The Rust Book" Scratchpad

This repository contains the source of my "The Rust Programming Language" book exercises.

Currently the exercises are related to the book version close to the [
f2a78f6](https://github.com/rust-lang/book/tree/f2a78f64b668f63f581203c6bac509903f7c00ee) commit.
Since this repository will probably stay here for a long time before I read the book again to check the exercises, the solutions can easyly be outdated on the current book release.
